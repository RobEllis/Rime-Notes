# Session Summary 2022-02-04
After our brief stay at the [[Lucky Liar]], [[Crowberry]] suggested we find somewhere to sleep. He brought us to the [[Speaker's House]], a modest yet nicely decorated building with a small garden, owned by [[Speaker Nimsy Huddle]], and her children, [[Scoop]], Doop, Boop, and Loop. With offerings of cookies and a hearty meal, the Speaker offered us her attic to stay in, and while [[Crowberry]] went home, we had our first night's rest in [[Icewind Dale]].

After waking, we had breakfast—potatoes, as is the tradition here apparently—and began making preparations to set off. While there, we heard about a series of murders taking place in [[Easthaven]], [[Targos]], and [[Bryn Shander]]. A wizard was also apprehended for murdering an adventuring party, and is to be burned in [[Easthaven]].

[[Ealadha Tachanka|Ealadha]], generously, offered [[Speaker Nimsy Huddle|Nimsy]] some gold to cover the expenses of the night.

Stopping by at the [[Happy Scrimshander]]—not as happy as we would've hoped—we bought some woodcarving supplies and some carpenter's supplies, and made ready to set off from [[Termalaine]] to [[Easthaven]].
