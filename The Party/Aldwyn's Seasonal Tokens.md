**Spring**: cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment and hope as winter’s sorrow passes

**Summer**: boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy and calls to action

**Autumn**: peace and goodwill, when summer’s harvest is shared with all

**Winter**: contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers
