# Summary
Has several layers of hoods, that's really all we know. 
Can cast mage armour! Doesn't know how. He claims to be scared of 'Mind Pirates' (a direct translation from a different language).

Comes from a place called Minaria? Apparently came here on a ship and it crashed! The ship wasn't a Minarian ship
