# Summary
A scholarly type, wearing nice clothes and adorned in rings.

### The Dream?
> As you rest, you close your eyes in the relative warmth of your bedroll and open them in what looks to be your sitting room back in Waterdeep. The fire crackles with an icy blue flame, however, and all the furnishings are coated with frost. The corners of your vision are hazy, obscured by a lattice of thin lines shattering your peripheral view like broken glass, or ice. Two armchairs face away from you, towards the fire, one clearly occupied. You can see little of the occupant; a large black felt hat with a midnight blue feather adorning it; two crossed legs wearing silken breeches and dragonhide boots both dripping with water; and an unnaturally pale hand with jet black, almost clawed, nails, resting on the arm of the chair. The figure is humming, a tune you recognise as belonging to a Waterdhavian opera you once attended. Almost as quickly as you recognise it, it ceases, and a voice emerges from the figure. Deep, yet refined; "Ah, you made it. Quite a trial, getting you here unnoticed to deliver you this message. You are not so hidden as you believe, ==qaal oruylv==. The servants of darkness have cast their eyes to this forsaken place in search of you, and they shall not relent. I offer safety to you - an ally, a confident, a sponsor to ease your path. Seek me out in the silent place, where no others are permitted to tread." And as the final words fade, so too does your vision as you awaken once more at the end of your rest.
