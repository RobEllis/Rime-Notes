# Session Summary 2022-02-05
As the party made their way into [[Termalaine]], we decided first and foremost to head into the market, to pick up some crampons and some snow shoes. After [[Kralen Grimm|Kralen]] got ripped off by [[Cuko]], getting chipped and cracked crampons, [[Crowberry]] decided to get some ==***JUSTICE***==, and returned Kralen's money; this is probably the nicest thing anyone has done to me and I will protect this boy with my life. 

Overhearing a town crier, we find out that [[Speaker Oarus Masthew]] is looking for adventurers to clear out a gem mine, and to meet him for details at the [[Blue Clam]]. Heading over, we got a prophecy from [[Tovonnen]] about flying snakes! We also find out that the gem mine is infested with kobolds, and with a possible link to the underdark, there could also be threats of other horrible monsters below (*ooOoOoOoOooooo*).

Accepting the quest, we began setting off to the gem mine, but not before picking up some fried fish from [[Haggy McHagg]], a local trader.
