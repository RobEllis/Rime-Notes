## Summary
The [[Ashen Wake]] was a ship built during the conquests of the [[Many-Arrows]]; during such a time, a series of rituals, involving ancient unknown magics, bound the crew together willingly. Under such a pact, the crew were bound to protect each other with their lives, as well as the life of the ship.

The central piece of this pact was a ritual stone, a rune-covered piece of smooth grey rock with the symbol of the [[Many-Arrows]] upon it. This stone, when held by a captain, allowed access to the previous knowledge (sic) of previous captains, and acted as a central figure of the [[Ashen Wake]], allowing it to be remade while maintaining the pact.

In recent years, the [[Ashen Wake]] has been between captains; while a new captain is decided, the crew has run the ship as a Brotherhood, waiting for a figure to rise to the station before granting them access. In much more recent history, [[Kralen Grimm]] has taken possession of the stone, with the objective of rescuing any surviving crew from a strange attack, where all crew were killed or taken.
