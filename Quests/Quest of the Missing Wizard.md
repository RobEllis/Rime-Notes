![[Dzaan-Dieing.png]]

As it turns out, Dzaan is dead. Apparently burned to death in front of the [[Easthaven Town Hall]]. Reportedly responsible for the deaths of several adventurers, which he himself hired. Upon being apprehended, using magics to attempt to evade capture, he was caught and executed.

The adventurers perished in many ways, all at the same campsite:
- One was burned
- One was shocked
- Another, killed by great blunt force

His former posessions:
- A scroll
- A grey bag
- A spellbook, missing from the [[Easthaven Garrison]]

Later, a [[Dzaan Secundus|second Dzaan]], a simulacrum, was found. He corroborated that the adventurers that perished above were the only ones who knew the location of the [[Lost Spire of Netheril]], and Dzaan killed them to preserve the secret.

This new Dzaan wished to become real, but could not achieve his goal while [[Dzaan Prime]] was alive. He was protected by [[New Character]].

When the party let me know of Prime's death, he quickly moved to request that he be made real. Thankfully, in the [[Lost Spire of Netheril]] was a magical device that could turn illusions real. The ritual seemed to be a success, and Dzaan Secundus was immensely grateful.
