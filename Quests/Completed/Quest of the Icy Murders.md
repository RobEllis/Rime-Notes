Each of the victims had ties to the establishments of the towns. It is possible those who died paid their way out of the sacrifice.

The culprit turned out to be [[Sephek Kaltro]], a former crewmate of [[Kralen Grimm|Kralen]]. He confessed that the murder victims all paid out of the sacrifices. He was later killed in an ensuing brawl, and was burned as a funerary rite.
