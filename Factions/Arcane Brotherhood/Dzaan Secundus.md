# Summary
When the party entered the [[Lost Spire of Netheril]] to seek out arcane knowledge, a simulacrum of Dzaan was found within. He wished to become real, but could not achieve his goal while [[Dzaan Prime]] was alive. He was protected by [[New Character]].

When the party let me know of Prime's death, he quickly moved to request that he be made real. Thankfully, in the [[Lost Spire of Netheril]] was a magical device that could turn illusions real. The ritual seemed to be a success, and Dzaan Secundus was immensely grateful.
