The Kingdom of Many-Arrows was an orc kingdom founded by Obould Many-Arrows in 1371 DR and recognized as a sovereign realm by several of the Silver Marches signatories the following year. It stretched from Mithral Hall in the west to the Moonwood in the east and to the Evermoors in the south.

A glimpse into the future made it known that the kingdom would last at least 100 years to the reign of King Obould VI, but even then, renegade shamans of Gruumsh attempted to return to the old orc ways and wished to attack their neighbors instead of continuing to foster peaceful relations with them.
