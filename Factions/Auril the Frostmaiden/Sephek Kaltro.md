# Summary
Sephek Kaltro was formerly a crewmate of the Ashen Wake. Seemingly unphased by the cold weather; olive complexion, dark pony tail and no body hair. Bright blue. Dressed in a stylish vest with matching pants and boots. Not armed or armoured. Seems to be implicated in the Cold Hearted Killings; possibly hunting down those who buy their way out of the sacrifices.
