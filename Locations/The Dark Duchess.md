The ripped sail belonging to Kralen is from a ship known as the Dark Duchess, which left port at Luskan. Scrying the magic mirror with Ealadha, Kralen discovered the ship sits in [[Icewind Dale]], trapped in the Ice.


### Thoughts

- Was the Dark Duchess responsible for the death of Kralen's crew?
