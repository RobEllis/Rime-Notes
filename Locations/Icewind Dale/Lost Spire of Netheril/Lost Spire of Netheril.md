A strange rough stone structure jutting out from the ground; does not appear to be a wizard tower, or conventionally built, but also does not seem to be natural either.

It seems to contain no conventional entrances, but has a steep tunnel off to the side... it seems to angle towards the tower but then winds out of view. Further investigation has determined that the tower has topsy-turvy gravity!

We also found someone that seems to be [[Dzaan Prime]] accompanied by a skeletal warrior!

More details:
- Status within are depictions of a hooded and bearded man with a staff
- There are torch sconces that hold no heat
- Arcane sigils of warding magic are within, and this place hella magic
- The age is difficult to discern, especially given the ice, but it is incredibly old
