Found in the howling caves north of [[Easthaven]]. 
It appears to be the musings of a Dwarf about the caves.

**Excerpt 1**
*“These caves are sacred to the frost giants. The carvings on the wall suggest that the giants came here to drown themselves. Did they use the hot spring as a sacrificial pool?”*

**Excerpt 2**
*“The wind truly sounds like a wailing woman. One could easily go mad in this place.”*

**Excerpt 3**
*“I think there’s someone living in these caves. Shortly after discovering the hot spring, I heard what sounded like singing. When the song ended with a shrill laugh, dread sunk its teeth in me. Ye gods, that horrible cackle! I shall leave these caves in the morning and ne'er return.”*
